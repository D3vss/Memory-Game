# Memory-Game
A game development project using C and GTK and SDL libraries 

The game is developed using C language and GTK library for the graphic interfaces and SDL for the sound effects.
The project is not very well structred as the code is not split into multiple files, there's only a header file. So it might be hard to read and understand.

Memory Game is a game development project that I have worked on in collaboration with Mohamed OUBLAL. It was about developing a game that helps people improve their memory in a fun and simple way. 
The concept of the game is very simple: depending on which level you choose, a number of cards will show on the screen and all you have to do is to memories the similar cards.
We have used the C language as well as the GTK library in the process. And I was charged to do the design of the game using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.

Working on the project was very fun and educational. Looking forward for more projects!
